<!--Heading tags (such as <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.) typically come with default 
    styling from web browsers and CSS frameworks that include margin and/or 
    padding. This default styling often includes some amount of top and bottom 
    margin, which can create space above and below the heading text, effectively 
    resulting in a line gap.

However, the amount of space created by heading tags can vary depending on the 
browser's default styles or any custom styles applied by the developer. It's also 
possible to override these default styles using CSS to adjust the spacing according 
to your preferences.

In summary, while heading tags themselves do not inherently create line gaps, the 
default styling associated with them often does result in some vertical space above 
and below the heading text. -->
